# transPGSï¼šPolygenic prediction for underrepresented populations through transfer learning by utilizing shared genetic similarity shared with European populations

# Introduction
Current GWASs have been predominantly conducted in individuals of European (EUR) ancestry, with 94.6% in the EUR population and only 3.7% in the East Asian (EAS) population and 0.2% in the African (AFR) population.
Due to this underrepresentation, the performance of PGS behaves poorly in non-EUR populations, particularly in populations of AFR ancestry. For example, the PGS accuracy reduced approximately 78% across multiple traits in individuals of AFR ancestry
relative to those of EUR ancestry; similarly, the accuracy of PGS across traits was on average 40% lower in individuals of South Asian ancestry and 5% lower in individuals of EAS ancestry compared to that in those of EUR ancestry. The poor transferability 
of PGS derived from EUR ancestry data to non-EUR populations leads to great concern in health disparities . Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop novel PGS methods which can exploit data across diverse populations to better perform genetic risk prediction.

Increasing sample sizes in non-EUR GWASs for the understanding of genetic architecture underlying complex phenotypes is a necessary road for understudied populations such as EAS and AFR; but this requires plenty of expense and time. 
Alternatively, integrating existing knowledge available from EURs into non-EURs by novel approaches may be another promising strategy to improve the portability of PGS. Actually, there is a deal of evidence that significant genetic
similarity exists between the EUR and non-EUR populations at both SNP and gene levels. Such genetic similarity provides theoretical and biological support for trans-ethnic leveraging of EUR information into non-EUR studies.
Currently, there are a range of trans-ethnic statistical methods that help enhance the transferability of PGS across distinct ancestral groups; however, how to optimally integrate EUR information into non-EUR genetic research remains unknown.

In the machine learning filed, transfer learning is recognized as a novel technique that enables the utilization of knowledge acquired from auxiliary samples to enhance learning capability in target samples, which are distinct yet 
related to the former (Bastani, 2021; Li, et al., 2023; Lu, et al., 2023; Pan and Yang, 2009; Tian, et al., 2022; Zhao, et al., 2022). By borrowing the idea of transfer learning,we propose transPGS to boost the genetic prediction accuracy 
in non-EUR populations by leveraging trans-ethnic genetic similarity shared with the EUR population. Theoretically, transPGS helps capture genetic information across diverse ancestral populations and renders the prediction more efficiently and accurately.
